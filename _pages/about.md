I'm a first year PhD student at the University of Copenhagen in the [CopeNLU lab](https://copenlu.github.io/) studying natural language processing and machine learning. Specifically, my research focuses on automated fact checking, scientific language understanding, and domain adaptation. Outside of NLP I'm an avid rock climber and dungeons and dragons nerd :dragon:.
