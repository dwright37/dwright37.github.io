**I'm on the academic and industry research job market! Please reach out if you know of opportunities.**

I'm currently a Danish Data Science Academy postdoctoral fellow visiting the [BlaBlaBlab](https://blablablab.si.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan. My research centers around the following mission: I want to make the world's knowledge **reliable** and **accessible**. This includes [real-world knowledge](https://aclanthology.org/2020.emnlp-main.256/), [scientific knowledge](https://aclanthology.org/2022.emnlp-main.117.pdf), and [diverse human knowledge](https://aclanthology.org/2020.emnlp-main.639/). The methods I use come from machine learning and natural language processing. **Reliability** is concerned with the [factuality](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.175/) and [faithfulness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12431) of different types of knowledge, as well as ensuring that ML systems themselves are [safe and interpretable](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19238). **Accessibility** is concerned with making ML systems which process different types of knowledge both [efficient](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01345) and [sustainable](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02065).

Previously I was a postdoc in the [Saints Lab](https://github.com/saintslab) working on sustainable AI, and did my PhD with [CopeNLU](https://copenlu.github.io/) where I worked on automated fact checking, automatic understanding and analysis of science communication, and domain adaptation. I received my master's degree from University of California, San Diego, and have worked at IBM Research and the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence on the Semantic Scholar project. I also write sometimes on [substack](https://dustinwright.substack.com/). Outside of science I like making music and playing table top role-playing games and rhythm games.
